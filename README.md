# Star Trek Sim - Game Engines 2 Assignment

A simulation of a Star Trek story made with Unity Engine.  The USS Enterprise embarks on another mission and this simulation shows the story of what happened. The seven scenes included in this project follow the storyboard below.

### Features
 - Various scenes with cool skyboxes, action and camera movement
 - Starship enterprise and enemy movements utilise steering behaviours such as seek, arrive, and pursue
 - Space battle scene with lasers and enemy explosions
 - Asteroid field chase scene with obstacle evasion until all enemies are destroyed
 - Smooth transitions between scenes
 - Music and sound effects
 - Voice acting to compliment story
 - Post processing to give the simulation a cinematic look
 - Great 3D models
 
 ### Favourite aspect
Favourite part is the chase in the asteroid field in Scene 6 where starship enterprise uses obstacle avoidance to dodge asteroid while being chased by enemies which crash into the asteroids.
The hyperwarp in Scene 7 is also cool, made by scaling the model in the z axis and increasing the FOV on the camera to make it seem like its warping through space.

## Storyboard
 - Starship enterprise takes off from a planet earth into space
 - Starship enterprise encounters fight with ships of a hostile species
 - The hostile ships battle with the enterprise, all of the hostiles are killed
 - A mothership appears deploying more hostile ships that move in on the starship
 - Starship enterprise flees through a asteroid field, making great maneuvers to dodge the asteroids while the hostile ships chase (object evasion to navigate and evade the asteroid field)
 - The enterprise gets enough time to charge up its energy enough to hyperwarp and gets away
